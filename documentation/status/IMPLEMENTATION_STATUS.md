# Implementation Status

Single source of truth for what is and isn't implemented. Use this to avoid hallucinating features that don't exist.

Last updated: 2026-02-25 (added Scheduler, File Organizer, Habit Tracker agents)

---

## ✅ Fully Implemented

### Core Infrastructure
- [x] LLM client (`GitHubModelsLLM`) wrapping OpenAI SDK against GitHub Models endpoint
- [x] ReAct loop (`reason_and_act`) — up to 6 iterations, 45s timeout, `max_tokens=3000`
- [x] Intent classification (`classify_intent`) for multi-agent routing
- [x] Agent process isolation — each agent runs as a separate `subprocess.Popen`
- [x] Per-agent memory system (working, episodic, semantic, personality, habits, consciousness) — **Personal Assistants only; Skills are stateless executors with no memory**
- [x] Memory consolidation, decay, and archiving
- [x] **Global consolidation background thread** — starts at app launch, runs every 24 h across ALL Personal Assistants (including inactive ones)
- [x] Log files written to project root; truncated on every `start.py` launch
- [x] 429 rate-limit error surfaced to user with wait-time estimate
- [x] Single-agent shortcut in Personal Assistant Hub (bypasses planner for Drive-only or Email-only commands)

**Composite IDs:** All stored messages are addressed as `"chat_id:message_id"` (e.g. `"1001:5"`).

### Files Agent — 48 Tools
All tools use Python stdlib only (`pathlib`, `shutil`, `zipfile`, `hashlib`, `os`). No credentials required for 43/48 tools.

**Credentials:** None required for core 43 tools. Gmail/Drive OAuth needed for 5 cross-agent tools.  
**Safety:** `_is_safe_path()` blocks ops on system directories; destructive ops default to `dry_run=True`.  
**Setup:** Full guide at `documentation/FILES_SETUP.md`.

### Calendar Agent (Google Calendar) — 19 Tools
All tools implemented and wired to Google Calendar API v3.

| Category | Tools | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| View & search | get_todays_events, get_tomorrows_events, get_upcoming_events, get_events_for_date, search_events, get_event, list_events | ✅ |
| Agenda | get_daily_agenda, get_weekly_agenda | ✅ |
| Create & modify | create_event, quick_add_event, update_event, delete_event, create_recurring_event | ✅ |
| Smart | find_free_slots, find_conflicts, set_reminder | ✅ |
| RSVP & management | accept_invite, decline_invite, list_calendars | ✅ |

**Auth:** `config/calendar_token.json` — generated on first OAuth flow; silently refreshed thereafter.  
**Preflight:** `_get_client()` raises `PermissionError` if not authorised — surfaces clean `auth_error` to user.  
**Setup:** See `documentation/setup/CALENDAR_SETUP.md`.

### Scheduler / Smart Calendar Agent — 8 Tools
New intelligence layer on top of the Calendar Agent. Uses same auth token.

| Category | Tools | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Slot finding | suggest_meeting_time, find_mutual_availability | ✅ |
| Focus protection | protect_deep_work_block, schedule_recurring_focus_time | ✅ |
| Analysis | optimize_day_schedule, get_scheduling_insights | ✅ |
| Conflict resolution | smart_reschedule_conflicts | ✅ |
| Time blocks | create_time_block | ✅ |

**Registry key:** `scheduler`  
**Auth:** Reuses `config/calendar_token.json` — no additional OAuth setup.  
**Key difference from Calendar Agent:** Never just CRUD — always reasons and proposes optimal solutions.

### File Organizer Agent — 10 Tools
Approval-driven organisation with archival policies. No credentials required.

| Category | Tools | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Plan workflow | scan_and_propose, preview_plan, apply_plan, discard_plan, list_plans | ✅ |
| Archival | archive_old_files, set_archival_policy, show_archival_policies, run_archival_policies | ✅ |
| App data | cleanup_app_data | ✅ |

**Registry key:** `file_organizer`  
**Data stores:** `data/organizer_pending_plans.json`, `data/organizer_archival_policies.json`  
**Safety:** Never calls `apply_plan` without explicit user confirmation; all destructive ops default to `dry_run=True`.

### Habit & Health Tracker Agent — 9 Tools
Completely new agent. No overlap with Calendar or Files agents.

| Category | Tools | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Habit management | add_habit, delete_habit, get_habits | ✅ |
| Logging | log_completion, daily_checkin | ✅ |
| Progress tracking | get_streak, get_weekly_report, get_habit_analytics | ✅ |
| Calendar integration | schedule_habit_on_calendar | ✅ |

**Registry key:** `habit_tracker`  
**Service:** `src/habit_tracker/habit_service.py`  
**Data stores:** `data/habits.json` (definitions), `data/habit_logs.json` (daily logs)  
**No credentials required** for all 8 core tools; Calendar integration requires Calendar auth.

### Personal Assistant Hub
- [x] Drive-only command routing → Drive Agent direct
- [x] Email-only command routing → Email Agent direct
- [x] NL-based cross-agent workflow planner (`plan_nl_workflow`) for combined commands
- [x] Agent capability registry (`agent_registry.py`) — ~10 tokens per agent, scales to N agents; **8 agents registered**: drive, email, whatsapp, files, calendar, scheduler, file_organizer, habit_tracker
- [x] Planning context: ~80 tokens for 8 agents (vs ~8,000 tokens in old flat-tool-list design)
- [x] Natural-language step format: orchestrator issues plain-English instructions, no tool signatures
- [x] Sequential multi-agent execution via `nl_step_runner.py` — each sub-agent runs its own full ReAct loop
- [x] Artifact handoff between agents (`artifacts_out` dict + `{output_key.field}` token substitution)
- [x] Drive → Email file path handoff: `artifacts_out["file_path"]` populated from `download_file` result
- [x] Composed final response from all agent results
- [x] **Hard-coded `__multi_agent__` personality** — warm, proactive, protective personal-assistant character baked in as prose; immune to personality trait slider edits
- [x] **`collective_consciousness.md`** — synthesised from every sub-agent’s `consciousness.md` each consolidation cycle; gives the PA a cross-domain mental model of the user
- [x] **WhatsApp agent** registered in `agent_registry.py` — available for PA workflows
- [x] **Telegram agent** registered in `agent_registry.py` — available for PA workflows
- [x] **Files agent** registered in `agent_registry.py` — available for PA workflows
- [x] **Calendar agent** registered in `agent_registry.py` — Google Calendar CRUD via PA
- [x] **Scheduler agent** registered in `agent_registry.py` — intelligent scheduling, focus blocks, insights
- [x] **File Organizer agent** registered in `agent_registry.py` — approval-workflow file organization
- [x] **Habit Tracker agent** registered in `agent_registry.py` — habit tracking, streaks, weekly reports

### UI
- [x] Streamlit chat UI for Drive Agent (port 8502)
- [x] Streamlit chat UI for Email Agent (port 8503)
- [x] Streamlit chat UI for WhatsApp Agent (WhatsApp green theme #25d366)
- [x] Streamlit chat UI for Telegram Agent (blue-grey theme)
- [x] Streamlit chat UI for Files Agent (blue theme #4a90d9 — no credentials required)
- [x] Streamlit chat UI for Multi-Agent / Personal Assistant (port 8504)
- [x] Agent Hub management UI (port 8501)
- [x] `start.py` / `stop.py` for launching/stopping all UIs
- [x] Per-agent personality trait sliders in Agent Hub

## ⚠️ Partial / Known Limitations

### `reply_to_message`
- Listed in tool description but **not wired in `_dispatch`** in `email_agent/orchestrator.py`.
- The LLM sees it as available, but calling it will return `Unknown tool: reply_to_message`.
- Workaround: Use `send_message` with a subject like `"Re: [original subject]"`.

### `download_file` (Drive)
- Downloads to a local path on the machine running the Streamlit server.
- When running from `start.exe`, the download location is relative to the executable directory.
- No in-UI file picker for destination — path must be specified in natural language or defaults to the project root.

### `download_attachment` (Email)
- Same constraint as Drive download — saves to server-side disk.
- No browser download prompt.

### `schedule_email`
- Scheduling is software-implemented (stored JSON, checked by a background scheduler).
- It is **not** a native Gmail scheduled send — it relies on the OctaMind process being running at send time.
- If the application is closed before the scheduled time, the email will not be sent.

### `export_to_calendar`
- Google Calendar write access requires additional OAuth scope (`calendar.events`).
- The `.ics` file export works unconditionally.
- Calendar write is implemented but depends on the token having the right scope — if not authorised, only `.ics` is saved.

### `apply_smart_labels` / `create_category_rules`
- Creates Gmail labels in the user's account.
- Label creation is irreversible via this tool — there is no `delete_label` tool.

### `bulk_rename` / `auto_organize` / `trash_duplicates` / `delete_old_versions`
- All default to `dry_run=True`. The agent will show a preview.
- To apply changes, the user must explicitly confirm or re-request with "yes, proceed" / "do it for real."

### `visualize_patterns`
- Returns chart-ready JSON data, not an actual rendered chart.
- The Streamlit UI does not currently render this data as a visual — it displays as formatted text.

### Agent Hub Automation (`auto_run`)
- The `auto_run` config field exists in `agents.json` but the automation scheduler is **not actively running** in the current build.
- Manual commands via chat always work; background auto-run does not trigger automatically.

## Known Bugs / Edge Cases

| Issue | Impact | Status |
|-------|--------|--------|
| GitHub Models rate limit (150 req/day, 15 req/min) | All agents fail with 429 after limit | Surfaced to user with wait-time; no workaround except waiting or switching model |
| `max_tokens=3000` vs context window | Very long tool results may exceed context; LLM truncates | No chunking implemented |
| Memory consolidation agent | ~~Consolidation task runs on startup but output is not surfaced in UI~~ **FIXED** — `ConsolidationRunner` daemon thread boots with the dashboard and runs all agents every 24 h | Memory improves continuously even for idle agents |
| Log file locked on Windows | Logs in `src/` may stay locked if processes don't exit cleanly | Truncated on next `start.py` |

---

## LLM Configuration

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Provider | GitHub Models (free tier) |
| Model | `gpt-4o` (via GitHub Models endpoint) |
| Rate limit | 15 requests/minute, 150 requests/day |
| `max_tokens` — ReAct loop | 3000 per iteration |
| `max_tokens` — compose response | 3000 |
| `max_tokens` — classify intent | 5 |
| ReAct max iterations | 6 |
| ReAct timeout | 45 seconds |
| Temperature — compose | 0.4 |

## API Scopes Required

### Google Drive
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive` (full Drive access)

### Gmail
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify` (read + send + labels)
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send`

### Google Calendar (optional)
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events` — required for `export_to_calendar` write path
- Without this scope, only `.ics` file export works
